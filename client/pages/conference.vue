      <p>The conference ATTENDING [TO] FUTURES examines the ambivalent role and responsibility of design as world-making at a moment in which the world »is presented in crisis« (Ghosn, Jazairy). Acknowledging the ways in which design (as practices, forms of knowledge, and sets of objects) is accountable for social and environmental injustice, the conference invites critical perspectives that scrutinize unchallenged disciplinary norms and dominant ways of knowing, being, doing, and imagining in design education, research, and practice. Drawing on current de-/anti-colonial, post-humanist, queer-feminist and disability discourses, the conference attempts a political reprogramming of design in order to generate transformative perspectives on design education, research, and practice.</p>

      <h2>1. Contested Histories — Unlearning</h2>
      <p>The first panel critically revises and problematizes the eurocentric, patriarchal, colonial, environmentally untenable, and capitalist traditions in which design is embedded and calls for an »unlearning« (Gayatri Spivak) of discriminatory, exclusive, oppressive, and »defuturing« (Toni Fry) codes and design practices that came into being because of them. The aim of this panel is to expose normative definitions of design, design epistemologies, and established ways of learning in order to understand ›why we design, what we design‹ (loosely based on Mary Lawhon) and to recognize how design produces inequality and subjugation.</p>
