      <p>The conference ATTENDING [TO] FUTURES examines the ambivalent role and responsibility of design as world-making at a moment in which the world »is presented in crisis« (Ghosn, Jazairy). Acknowledging the ways in which design (as practices, forms of knowledge, and sets of objects) is accountable for social and environmental injustice, the conference invites critical perspectives that scrutinize unchallenged disciplinary norms and dominant ways of knowing, being, doing, and imagining in design education, research, and practice. Drawing on current de-/anti-colonial, post-humanist, queer-feminist and disability discourses, the conference attempts a political reprogramming of design in order to generate transformative perspectives on design education, research, and practice.</p>

      <h2>We ask for contributions that are related to but not limited to the following questions and topics</h2>
      <p>How are design practices embedded in socio-political contexts and hegemonic power structures and how do they (re-)produce exclusion?</p>
      <p>How can persistent structures of systemic oppression and privilege in design be recognized and changed?</p>
      <p>How can approaches for the invention and constitution of future worlds be developed without perpetuating pejorative constructions of race, class, gender and ability?</p>
      <p>How can we reprogram education, research and practice, in order to lead design out of defuturing ways of knowing, being, and doing?</p>
      <p>How can we deal with the »monsters« (Ahmed Ansari) that design helps to create and that inversely help design into being?</p>
      <p>How do supposed design innovations contribute to the destruction of possible futures, rather than opening up new spaces of possibility?</p>
      <p>What does a critical revision and transformation of contested histories and entrenched narratives entail?</p>
      <p>Which counter-hegemonic projects already exist, and how can they be amplified and mobilized?</p>
      <p>How can design itself be employed as a tool to critically examine the socio-political configuration of historical events as well as to create possible futures?</p>
      <p>What are the modalities of education as defamiliarization?</p>
      <p>Which tools, methods, and media can be used to develop things, material practices, images, spaces, and bodies that transform existing hegemonies and subversively reverse normative orders?</p>
