      <h2>We ask for contributions that are related to but not limited to the following questions and topics</h2>
      <p>&rarr; How are design practices embedded in socio-political contexts and hegemonic power structures and how do they (re-)produce exclusion?</p>
      <p>&rarr; How can persistent structures of systemic oppression and privilege in design be recognized and changed?</p>
      <p>&rarr; How can approaches for the invention and constitution of future worlds be developed without perpetuating pejorative constructions of race, class, gender and ability?</p>
      <p>&rarr; How can we reprogram education, research and practice, in order to lead design out of defuturing ways of knowing, being, and doing?</p>
      <p>&rarr; How can we deal with the »monsters« (Ahmed Ansari) that design helps to create and that inversely help design into being?</p>
      <p>&rarr; How do supposed design innovations contribute to the destruction of possible futures, rather than opening up new spaces of possibility?</p>
      <p>&rarr; What does a critical revision and transformation of contested histories and entrenched narratives entail?</p>
      <p>&rarr; Which counter-hegemonic projects already exist, and how can they be amplified and mobilized?</p>
      <p>&rarr; How can design itself be employed as a tool to critically examine the socio-political configuration of historical events as well as to create possible futures?</p>
      <p>&rarr; What are the modalities of education as defamiliarization?</p>
      <p>&rarr; Which tools, methods, and media can be used to develop things, material practices, images, spaces, and bodies that transform existing hegemonies and subversively reverse normative orders?</p>
