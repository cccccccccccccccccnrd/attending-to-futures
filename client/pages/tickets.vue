      <p>Please register for the <strong>General Admission</strong> ticket to access <strong>all keynotes, talks, and the roundtable, lecture performance, and theatre performance.</strong></p>
      <p>If you would like to join one of the <strong>online workshops</strong>, register for a <strong>General Admission + Workshop</strong> ticket. The amount of tickets for each workshop is limited, please only register if you are absolutely certain you can attend. Keep in mind that you can only purchase one ticket per person.</p>
